This is the QooxDoo-part of the framework. Usually you don't need to touch
this. If you want to help with the developement of this part, please get
a copy of the framework at http://qooxdoo.org and put it into

  source/qooxdoo-1.3-sdk

Then you can do

  ./generate.py build

for a binary-build, or

  ./generate.py clean
  ./generate.py source

for a source-build, which helps for some faster development. Every time
you switch from source to build or vice versa, you have to "clean", and
then restart the Framework. It will detect automatically which of the
two (source or build) is active.
