Some examples for the QooxView Framework

=== Section 0 - General files

== 0-1 Redirection

Simple redirection-file to the port - just so you don't have to go
and google for meta-redirect

=== Section 1 - View only

In this section, view-only parts are shown, which don't make use of the
Data-handling available in QooxView.

== 1-1 Hello

The most simple Frontend to be used - only a html-textbox

== 1-2 Button

Adding a button and some small reaction if someone presses it

== 1-3 Frontend

Little bit more complex layout with HTML-rendering, and some scripts
that are called to fill in the text-boxes.

== 1-4 TwoViews

Two tabs that show an Overview and a Detail of some of the process.
This can be extended to as many tabs as necessary

== 1-5 Chat

A very simple chat console with an entry-text and a discussion-
part that shows the last 10 lines. It is possible to chose a name,
or to just type anonymously whatever you want


=== Yet to be done

Examples of using the session-ids and how to use the Entities!
